# Beast-Among-Us
Third Project for Experimental Game Design (CS342). Based off a quote from https://www.philosophybasics.com/general_quotes.html.

**Quote**:
â€œHe who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god"

**Objective**: Last for as many days as possible. Blend into society by performing jobs or transform into a beast and go hunting in  the woods.
